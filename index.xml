      <description>In the quest to create a perfect bracket using code, I, along with others, created code to create the best bracket there could be.

      <description>This May I&amp;rsquo;ll graduate from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with a Bachelor of Journalism degree in Sports Media and Communication. I currently work in the Department of Nebraska Athletics Communications Department and as a tutor. Soon, I will take on the position of being an official for intramural flag football as well here at UNL.
My R Studio skills are still developing as I am in my second coding class, but I&amp;rsquo;m always eager to learn more and improve my abilities.</description>
