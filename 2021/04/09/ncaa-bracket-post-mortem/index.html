<p>Overall, my bracket did pretty well. This is the best performing bracket that I have ever had and plan to bust out the code next year as well. I ended up in the 99.7 percentile on ESPN’s tournament challenge, ultimately placing just above 40,000. While I didn’t win the nation, I did claim victory in the class by 10 points. All it takes is one first round matchup I now know.</p>
<p>I missed eight games total in the first round. They are:</p>
<p>Ohio-Virginia (Virginia had a 72.8% chance to win.)
LSU-St. Bonaventure (LSU was supposed to lose.)
BYU-UCLA (BYU had a 90.8% chance to win.)
Texas-Abiline Christian (I didn’t see this coming and neither did you.)
Purdue-North Texas (Ditto.)
Ohio State-Oral Roberts (Ditto.)
Tennessee-Oregon State (This was a tossup in the model. 51.6% Tenn to 28.4% OSU.)
San Diego State-Syracuse (SDSU was supposed to win with a prediction of 64.6%.)</p>
<p>Some of the upsets may have been predictable, but others not so much. I would have never guessed UCLA would be in the Final Four. In my individual bracket, I did have Syracuse winning, but that was just a gut feeling. There was little to no logic behind that pick.</p>
<p>I believe I did a little bit of overfitting. I’m not sure what I would do in the future, but I would not go 100% by the bracket. I had four factors overall and maybe I need to only do two. OR maybe I need more. Only time will tell. Trial and error.</p>
<p>I know for certain that I would not have done as well without the model. I created another bracket to do on my own without the help of the code and rather than being in 40,000, I finished 8 Millionth.</p>
